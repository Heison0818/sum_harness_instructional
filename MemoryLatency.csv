problemsize, sum_dire got it,wait
eg:
sum_direct, MFLOP/s,% of memory bandwidth utilized ,Avg memory latency
Sum_indirect
Sum_vector 
so can can compare  it? 
the problem size should be the same?
yes
another problem
he menetion to  use our local machine and try>? it that mean we need to run it on vscode?
MFLop/s, sum_dire, sum_indire, sum_vector? 
Memory bandwidth, sum_dire, sum_indire, sum_vector
Memory latency, sum_dire, sum_indire, sum_vector
got it 
can i do it on python?
so i need to calculate it first, and then put all the data to the txt file, and python just  create the diagraam?
